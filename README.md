This repository contains the code for the NYU DevOps Product Squad project. This service handles product operations on a an e-commerce website.

## Overview

The product service is a Python Flask application that provides a RESTful API for managing products in an e-commerce website. It is part of a microservices architecture and is designed to be deployed in a containerized environment.

The `/service` folder contains our `models.py` file for our model and a `routes.py` file for our service. The `/tests` folder has test case starter code for testing the model and the service separately.

## How to get started

### Reset database/model

```bash
flask db-create
```

### Run the app

```bash
flask run
```

### Run the tests

```bash
make test
```

# Database Schema

The product service uses a SQLite database to store product data. The database schema is defined in the `models.py` module. The schema consists of a single table called `products` with the following columns:

| Column    | Type    | Description               | Constraints               |
|-----------|---------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| id        | Integer | Unique product identifier | Primary key, autoincrement|
| name      | String  | Product name              | Not null                  |
| img_url   | String  | Product image URL         | Not null                  |
| description| String  | Product description       |                           |
| price     | Float   | Product price             | Not null                  |
| rating    | Integer | Product rating            | Not null, default=0        |
| category  | String  | Product category          |                           |
| status    | Enum    | Product status            | Not null, default="active"|

## Constraints and Validations

- **id**: Must be an integer greater than 0.
- **name**: Must be a non-empty string.
- **img_url**: Must be a non-empty string.
- **description**: Can be an empty string.
- **price**: Must be a float representing the price in dollars.
- **rating**: Must be an integer representing the rating, default is 0.
- **category**: Must be a string representing the category.
- **status**: Must be one of the predefined values in the Status enum, default is "active".

# API Endpoints

Overview of the API endpoints for the product service:

1. [Root URL](#root-url) - The root URL for the service
2. [Product Endpoints](#product-endpoints) - Endpoints for managing products
    1. Create a new product
    2. Get a list of all products
    3. Delete a product
3. [Error Handling](#error-handling) - How the service handles HTTP errors

## Root URL

The root URL for the service is `/products`. All routes are relative to this URL.

## Product Endpoints

The service provides the following endpoints for managing products:

| Method | URI              | Description                         |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| GET    | /products        | Retrieves a list of all products    |
| GET    | /products/<id>   | Retrieves a single product by its ID|
| POST   | /products        | Creates a new product               |
| PUT    | /products/<id>   | Updates a product by its ID         |
| DELETE | /products/<id>   | Deletes a product by its ID         |

## Error Handling

The service uses the `@app.errorhandler` decorator to handle HTTP errors. The `common/error_handlers.py` module contains the error handling code. The `common/status.py` module contains the HTTP status constants.
